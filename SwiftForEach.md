# Swift `forEach` Method

The `forEach` method in Swift is a powerful and convenient way to iterate over elements in a collection, such as arrays, dictionaries, or sets. It provides a closure that is executed for each element in the collection.

## Syntax

```swift
collection.forEach { element in
    // Code to execute for each element
}
